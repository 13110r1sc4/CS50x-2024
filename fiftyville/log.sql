--                            If you have security footage from the bakery parking lot, you might want to look for cars that left the parking lot in that time frame.

--                            Earlier this morning, before I arrived at Emma's bakery, I was walking by the ATM on Leggett Street and saw the thief there withdrawing some money.

--                              --> 1. Emma is new suspect
--                                  2. Look at ATM transactions before 10:15

--              + Raymond. : As the thief was leaving the bakery, they called someone who talked to them for less than a minute. In the call, I heard the thief say that they were
--                            planning to take the earliest flight out of Fiftyville tomorrow. The thief then asked the person on the other end of the phone to purchase the flight ticket.

--                              --> 1. Look at phone_calls on 07/28 with duration of less than 1 minute
